**Make cool tweaks**. By using plugins and predesigned themes, you can make Jekyll do cool stuff. Some of the things I personally like is that you can
* [optional] Extend functionality using [plugins](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins).
* [optional] Choose a theme that fits your dataviz.
* [optional] Tweak the CSS of your site to personalize further. Read more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#customizing-your-themes-css).
* [optional] Set up your site so that you can render math beautifully using latex.

You can find info about themes here https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll and there's also lots of info about whatever you're interested in on line. Play around. Hopefully you'll have fun.
