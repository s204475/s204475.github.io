### Drugs and naroctics in San Francisco

Like many states, San Fransisco has had its issues with handling crime related to drugs and narcotics. The following is a deep dive into how crime reports have evolved over the years between 2003 to 2025.

**San Francisco's Battle Against Drug Crimes: A Yearly Overview**

<iframe src="/assets/figures/drug time series.png" width="1000" height="600"></iframe>

Over the years, San Francisco has faced a fluctuating battle against drug-related crimes. This bar chart vividly illustrates the annual counts of drug/narcotic crimes, showcasing the peaks and troughs in the city's past and ongoing efforts to curb illegal drug activities. Each bar represents a year, with the height indicating the number of reported incidents. Notice how it has steadily dropped since 2009, but seems to be picking back up from 2022. 
There could be numerous causs for the steady droprate. Crime overall has been steadily decreasing in San Francisco, but not as much as is reflected in drug/narcotics. Recreational cannabis was legalised in 2018 which would also account for a drop in marijuanna-related crimes [BBC, "Recreational cannabis use becomes legal in California, 2018"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42532776). The spike seen in 2022 could reflect the national fentanyl crisis that America is facing which has hit San Francisco especially hard [San Francisco Chronolice, "Drug Overdose Epidemic", 2025](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/san-francisco-drug-overdose-deaths/), but fentanyl deaths have been on the rise since 2016 [Council of Foreign relations, "Fentanyl and the U.S. Opioid Epidemic", 2025](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/fentanyl-and-us-opioid-epidemic), so it should not only spike after 2022. However, the Corona epidemic could arguably also help explain the lower counts in the years 2019-2023 despite the fentanyl crisis.

**District Dynamics: Hourly Drug Crime Trends Across San Francisco**

Notice how much the day of the week actually affects drug-related crimes. It is clear that the weekend sees less overall reports except for at 5am where very little crime seems to occur at all no matter the week day. It is interesting to see that even drug crimes seems to somewhat take the weekends off. For buglaries/theft it would make sense to see less crime over weekends, as people are home and harder to steal from, but the use of narcotics should not have this limitation. However, it is important to note that this data reflects reports of crimes and not the actual occurances. For a crime to be reported it needs to be witnessed, and if people are doing drugs at home over the weekend that is not reflected in this data.
